              <ul>
                  <li> Previously known as 7, Race Course Road</li>
                  <li> Narendra Modi was born Narendrabhai Damodardas Modi on 17 September 1950. He uses Damodardas as his middle name — Gujaratis have a tradition of using the names of their fathers as their middle names—but he is widely known as Narendra Modi.(Marino 2014, pp. 4-5)</li> 
                  <li> Sources stating that RSS had a deep impact on the political hierarchy of the BJP, specially in the case of Narendra Modi.</li>
                  <li> Sources describing Modi's administration as complicit in the 2002 violence.</li>
                  <li> In 2012, a court stated that investigations had found no evidence against Modi.</li>
                  <li> Sources stating that Modi has failed to improve human development indices in Gujarat:</li>
                  <li> Sources describing that India has experienced a backslide in democracy:</li>
                  <li> Sources discussing the controversy surrounding Modi:
                  <li> Applications were filed with the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) under the RTI Act seeking details of his arrest. In reply, the PMO said it maintains official records on Modi only since he became the prime minister in 2014. Despite this claim, the official website of the PMO contains information about Modi from the 1950s.
                  <li> Replying to an RTI query, the School of Open Learning said it did not have any data of students who received a BA degree in 1978. Jayantibhai Patel, a former political science professor of Gujarat University, said the subjects listed in Modi's MA degree were not offered by the university when Modi was studying there. In 2016, Delhi University deemed the BA degree to be authentic.
                  <li> The exact number of people killed in the train burning is variously reported. For example, the BBC says it was 59, while The Guardian put the figure at 60.
                  <li> "The Narendra Modi led government completed two years in power in May 2016 and the prime minister has made his mark on both the domestic and foreign policy fronts. It is important to assess how successful his initiatives have been in the arena of foreign affairs in comparison to his predecessors. In this regard, this paper identifies and examines the key trends and issues in foreign policy under the Modi led administration and the measures needed to translate speeches and policies into action. Modi government has also taken a serious node of relations with middle-east nations, as well as Iran and Israel."</li>
